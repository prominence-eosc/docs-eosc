PROMINENCE
==========

PROMINENCE is a platform which allows users to exploit idle cloud resources for running containerized workloads.

* **Flexible submission** Submit jobs using a simple batch system style command line interface from your laptop. And your desktop. Or from anywhere else. Alternatively, interact programmatically using a RESTful API.
* **Reliability and reproduceability** All jobs are run in containers to ensure they will can run reliably anywhere and are reproducible.
* **MPI ready** Run multi-node Open MPI, Intel MPI or MPICH jobs in addition to single-node HTC jobs.
* **Workflows** Construct complex workflows by specifying the dependencies between different jobs.
* **Multi-cloud native** Go beyond a single cloud and leverage the resources and features available across many clouds.
* **Invisible infrastructure** All infrastructure provisioning is handled completely automatically and is totally transparent to the user.
