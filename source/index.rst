PROMINENCE
==========

PROMINENCE is a platform which allows users to exploit idle cloud resources for running containerised workloads. From a user's perspective PROMINENCE appears like a standard batch system.

Computing resources are provided by the EGI FedCloud sites which support token-based authentication. Currently these are:

* IN2P3-IRES
* INFN-CATANIA-STACK

PROMINENCE was originally developed in the Fusion Science Demonstrator in EOSCpilot. The European Open Science Cloud for Research pilot project was funded by the European Commission, DG Research & Innovation under contract no. 739563. This work is also co-funded by the EOSC-hub project (Horizon 2020) under Grant number 777536.
